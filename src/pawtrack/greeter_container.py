"""DimOS glue for the greeter loop: wander -> identify -> select -> navigate
-> greet.

This container orchestrates the loop but keeps every step a separable seam, so a
more capable module can later replace any one of them:

- wander -> DimOS ``PatrollingModule`` via the injected ``PatrollingModuleSpec``
  (``start_patrol`` / ``stop_patrol`` / ``is_patrolling``).
- identify -> :func:`pawtrack.identify.detect_all` (multi-box VLM).
- select -> :func:`pawtrack.visited_registry.select_target` over a
  :class:`pawtrack.visited_registry.VisitedRegistry` (random, not greeted in the
  last ``revisit_forget_s`` seconds).
- navigate (approach) -> :func:`pawtrack.approach_geometry.approach_velocity`
  over the geometric ground distance from the raycast (the seam a real planner
  would replace).
- phase decisions -> the pure :class:`pawtrack.greeter_state.GreeterMachine`.
- greet -> halt, then wave once with ``Hello`` (1016) whichever way the person
  faces; afterward recover with ``RecoveryStand`` (1006) + ``BalanceStand``
  (1002) so it can walk again -- via the injected GO2 connection (a no-op
  off-robot). There is no orbit-to-front step: any seated person reached at a
  safe standoff gets a wave.

The per-tick logic lives in :meth:`_tick`, callable synchronously (the loop
thread just calls it on a clock), so the orchestration is unit-testable with
fakes for the models, the patrol spec, and the connection -- no GPU or robot.
